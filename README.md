## About :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
 
Simple Music Player App is created using java. After installing this app when we open it, it asks for a permission to access all the media in that device. Once the permission is granted all the musics in that device are shown in a list view. If we click on a music it starts playing. Even if we press back and the app is open in background the musics will be played. We can chenge seek and also change music. If we don't change the musics will be played one after another in queue. So, this app gives user an uninterrupted listening to musics which exist in device storage. This app is user-friendly and totally safe to use.
